A Ruby on Rails Yelp clone that integrates with the Google Maps API and includes features like user comments, star ratings, image uploading, and user authentication. This app is designed to allow users to create new places such as restaurants, bars, food marts, etc. It also allows users to add photos, rate,  and comment on these places. A the top left of the page you can find the buttons to sign up, sign in, and create a new place. You cannot create, comment, or add a photo to a place without being signed in. Using Google Maps API, once you create your place it will appear on a map. After the place is created and users make comments and/or add photos, they will appear at the bottom of the specific place page. To get to the place page, simply click on the place on the home page. Only comments and ratings will show for each place on the home page. You can also view your profile by clicking 'My Profile' at the top left, while you are logged in. Your profile will show your profile email, when you enrolled, your total number of comments, and how many times you have given a specific rating-i.e., 1 total 5 star reviews. It will also show each comment and each of your created places.
